<h2> Notes</h2>

<p>Windows opened as separate tabs are distinct from the original ones</p>
<ul>
    <li> original background page can only be opened via clicking the background page link in extension settings</li>
    <li>popup opened by clicking extension icon is alwways a different instance than the one opened in separate tab</li>
</ul>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        the "forked" pages are still exceptional pages in that they still have equal permissions
        and other relationships that a normal backgorund page/popup would have.
        E.g. they exchange messages etc.
        The only issue is their coexistence, i.e. unusual interaction of actions this may generate

    </li>
    <li> as long as the "forked" page does not interfere with the application logic, it can be well used for testing</li>
    <li> e.g. in popup, when the tab does not modify the global application state spontaneously (e.g. via timer) everything should be fine</li>
</ul>
