<h2> Notes</h2>

<p>Windows opened as separate tabs are distinct from the original ones</p>
<ul>
    <li>original background page can only be opened via clicking the background page link in extension settings</li>
    <li>popup opened by clicking extension icon is always a different instance than the one opened from here in separate tab</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        the "forked" pages are still exceptional pages in that they still have equal permissions
        and other relationships that a normal backgorund page/popup would have.
        E.g. they exchange messages etc.
        The only issue is their coexistence, i.e. unusual interaction of actions this may generate

    </li>
    <li> as long as the "forked" page does not interfere with the logic of the whole application, it can be well used for testing</li>
    <li> e.g. in popup, when the tab does not modify the global application state spontaneously (e.g. via timer) everything should be fine.</li>
    <li> As a rule of thumb, when only one instance of each type (popup / background page) exists, the extension should function perfectly.
      Obviously, a background page opened by the links above MAY interfere with the original one.
      Popup however is <b> safe </b> as long as you do not open it both as a separate tab and via extension icon
     </li>
</ul>
