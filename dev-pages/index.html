         * 1. Wait for the extension to be loaded (when this page is loaded simultaneously with the extension)
         * It cannot be opened directly via commandline.
         * 2. Open util page that is a part of the extension
         * (chrome.runtime API is apparently not accessible from a local file (file:// protocol), so no contact with an extension is allowed)
         * 3. On click events send messages to the background page, that can create new tabs and can access any extension pages.
         * Why?
         * - even extension resources (such as chrome-extension://<id>/some_page.html) cannot directly open the background page.
