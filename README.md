## Prerequisites

### Node.js setup

Ubuntu:
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs build-essential
```

macOS / Windows - install newest (LTS) version available from [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Development

As for now, a bare-bones version is configured. First, build the app
using:
```
npm run dev
``` 
It launches webpack in watch mode, so every change will be rebuild live.
