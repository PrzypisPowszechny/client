## Relevant and specific



#### Browser extension obligations

https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/program_policies

Requirement of explicit privacy policy and data policy
(note that not some information is relevant to Chrome Apps
(which we are not)).




#### Publishing extension
https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2714278?hl=en

It takes up to an hour before the extension is published.
In practice, sometimes much less.




#### Chrome extension development:


Many sources that together document well how Chrome extension is identified (how keys and ids work)
https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest/key
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40134044/webpack-2-x-does-webpack-public-path-still-work
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37317779/making-a-unique-extension-id-and-key-for-chrome-extension

#### Versioning

## What we could use

#### Useful redux state management tool for chrome extension
https://github.com/tshaddix/react-chrome-redux

It is also compatible with asynchronous dispatches: https://github.com/tshaddix/react-chrome-redux/wiki/Advanced-Usage
